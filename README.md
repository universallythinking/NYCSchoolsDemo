I appreciate being considered for this position.

A few notes:
I used Swift 4.0 because that is what the development machine I had access to would allow.

This also applies to the iOS version.

The UI is not pretty, but it is functional.

I can resubmit this during the week of May 11th, if needed.  I am currently out of town for a family event and will have more time to work on this over the next week.
